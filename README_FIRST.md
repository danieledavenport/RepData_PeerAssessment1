## README First, Please

I created this course project in the latest version of RStudio
without changing any defaults.  

My R markdown code is in the file PA1_template.Rmd.  No intermediate
PA1_template.md file was created.  

The html file prouce by running knitr is named PA1_template.html.  

Contrary to the instructions, the figures which were created as png 
files are in the directory PA1_template_files/figure-html.
